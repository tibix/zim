====== Purge - Best practice ======
Created Thursday 16 June 2016

1. Set daily / weekly purges for every different message type crossing UL BRIDGE. To configure cleanup, use the Configuration Manager of the UL BRIDGE available from the UL DASHBOARD.
2. Watch regularly the **uldb.log** size.
3. If the **UL PERSISTENCE** file increases too much, look which table is not purged by using the following
	CLI: //./jmx-client.sh com.ullink.ultools.dao.core:type=* getSize//
4. Set purges for the UL PERSISTENCE tables with too much records.
