====== Add INI file ======
Created Thursday 02 June 2016

[ ] Open bridge Setup page 
[ ] Select Advanced View (from left bottom corner)
[ ] Click on **"Add ..."** button (from right bottom corner)
[ ] On the "**Name:"** input box (top left corner) insert the name of the INI file (is best to name it as you CFB file - just the name, no extension).
[ ] Copy the content of your ini file in the large white space (editing area).
[ ] If the option "View property values" is checked, your config place holders should show the actual values instead of variable name.
[ ] When you are happy with your INI file, click on "**OK"** button
[ ] If all steps are done correctly, you should have a new plugin showing in the **"Plugins"** page. 


==== Note: if session.sendercompid and session.targetcompid are not resolved, is because the properties for this values were not configured in the global ini file of the bridge ====
