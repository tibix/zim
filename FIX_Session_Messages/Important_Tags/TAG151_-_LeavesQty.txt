Created Wednesday 08 June 2016

Quantity open for further execution. If the OrdStatus ([[TAG39 - OrderStatus|39]]) is Canceled, DoneForTheDay, Expired, Calculated, or Rejected (in which case the order is no longer active) then LeavesQty could be 0, otherwise 
**LeavesQty** = **OrderQty** ([[TAG38 - OrderQty|38]]) â€“ **CumQty** ([[TAG14 - CumQty|14]]).
