====== TAG17 - ExecID ======
Created Wednesday 08 June 2016

Unique identifier of execution message as assigned by sell-side (broker, exchange, ECN) (will be 0 (zero) for ExecType (50) =I (Order Status)).  
Uniqueness must be guaranteed within a single trading day or the life of a multi-day order.  
Firms which accept multi-day orders should consider embedding a date within the ExecID field to assure uniqueness across days. (Prior to FIX 4. this field was of type int)
