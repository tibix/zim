====== TAG34 - MsgSeqNum ======

Created Thursday 26 May 2016

All FIX messages are identified by a unique sequence number. 
Sequence numbers are initialized at the start of each trading day starting at one and incremented throughout the session. 
Monitoring sequence numbers will enable parties to identify and react to missed messages and to synchronize applications when reconnecting during a FIX session. Furthermore the FIX protocol assumes complete ordered delivery of messages between parties.
