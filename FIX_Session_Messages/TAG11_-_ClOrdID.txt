====== TAG11 - ClOrdID ======
Created Tuesday 31 May 2016

Unique identifier for Order as assigned by the buy-side (institution, broker, intermediary  etc.) (identified by SenderCompID (49) or OnBehalfOfCompID (5) as appropriate).  Uniqueness must be guaranteed within a single trading day.  Firms, particularly those  which electronically submit multi-day orders, trade globally or throughout market close periods, should ensure  uniqueness across days, for example by embedding a date within the ClOrdID field.
