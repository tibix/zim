====== Heartbeats ======
Created Thursday 26 May 2016

===== Heartbeats - Tag 35=0 (Message Type = HeartBeat) =====

==== Utilization ====

Heart Beat Messages are sent periodically when there is no activity. This is to make sure that the other party is still alive. 
When each side of a FIX connection has not sent any data for [HeartBtInt] seconds, they will transmit a Heartbeat message. If there is still no Heartbeat message received after (HeartBtInt + “some reasonable transmission time”) seconds then the connection should be considered lost and corrective action be initiated.
The heartbeat will check if the message sequence number is correct, and so will make sure that no messages have been lost.

Ex:  8=FIX.4.2|9=56|**35=0**|49=SCI|56=TCI|34=13|52=20050816-05:04:41|57=ADMIN|10=103|
