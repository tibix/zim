===== Execution Report (execution) - Tag 35=8 (Message Type: Execution Report) =====

==== Utilization ====

In this example the execution report is used to inform the counterparty that an execution has been carried out on the market. Execution report is identified with (35=8, execution report). The execution report is also used to change the status if the order (Pending new, partially filled, cancelledâ€¦). The type of report is determined with tag 39, which is the new status of the order. We know that it is an execution because the status is in this example set to partially filled (39=1).
The order is totally filled when the number of shares executed is equals to the total order quantity. The last execution set the status of the order to Filled (39=2)
