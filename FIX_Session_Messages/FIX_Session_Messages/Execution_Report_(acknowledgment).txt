====== Execution Report (acknowledgment) ======
Created Tuesday 31 May 2016

===== Execution Report (acknowledgement) - Tag 35=8 (Message Type: Execution Report) =====

==== Utilization ====

The **FIX** protocol **does not support** **individual message acknowledgment**. However, a number of application messages require explicit application level acceptance or rejection. New Orders, cancel requests, cancel/replace requests require specific application level response. The acceptance is confirmed by sending an execution report.
There are several execution reports types : New, Partially Filled, Filled, Done for day, Cancelled, Replaced, Rejected and some others. In this example we will use the execution report to acknowledge a new order. An execution report is identified with (35=8, execution report). The type of execution report is determined with tag 39. In this case this is for a new order (39=0)
There are two important tags in an execution report : First, tag 39 (Order Status) which is the current status of the order on the market. The second one is tag 150 (Exectype) which precise the type of execution.

Ex: 8=FIX.4.2|9=232|**35=8**|49=TCI|56=SCI|34=741|52=20050816-10:29:06|50=TRDN|57=1441316|22=4|1=BG21|55=AGV|48=DE0006911324|37=0002360574941|11=20050816-00039|**150=0**|**20=0**|**39=0**|54=1|**38=30000**|59=0|17=02000858|40=2|**44=0.16**|**151=30000**|31=0|32=0|6=0|14=0|204=0|10=147|
