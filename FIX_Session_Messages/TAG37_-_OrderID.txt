====== TAG37 - OrderID ======
Created Wednesday 08 June 2016

Unique identifier for Order as assigned by sell-side (broker, exchange, ECN).  
Uniqueness must be guaranteed within a single trading day. 
Firms which accept multi-day orders should consider embedding a date within the OrderID field to assure uniqueness across days.
